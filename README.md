# Single-Shot-Multibox-Detector
The Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) project involves the implementation and utilization of an advanced object detection model in computer vision applications. SSD is a real-time, single-shot detection algorithm capable of accurately identifying and localizing multiple objects within an image simultaneously.
